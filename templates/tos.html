Additionally, You shall provide us with documentation that the withholding and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.</p>

<p>4.4 Should You have any dispute as to fees associated with your account, please contact us at help@Videntity.com within 90 days of the date of the activity that generated such dispute, and we will attempt to resolve the matter.

</p>

</h2>10. If You Pay Videntity.</h2>

</h3>10.1 Charges.</h3> This section 7 applies in all situations in which you directly pay us. If you pay a company other than us for the service, then the charges and billing terms are as stated by the other company. Even if you do not pay for the service, you may still incur charges incidental to using the service; for example, charges for Internet access, mobile text messaging, or other data transmission.

<h3>10.2 Payment.</h3> When you create a billing account, you enter your payment method. You must be authorized to use the payment method. You authorize us to charge you for the service using your payment method and for any paid feature of the service for which you choose to sign-up or use while this contract is in force. You will pay service charges in advance. We may charge you a different amount than what you approved. If it is a greater amount, we will tell you the amount and the date of the charge at least 10 days before we make the charge. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and notify you in advance of the difference. We may bill you for more than one of your prior billing periods together. If we informed you that the service will be provided indefinitely or automatically renewed, we may automatically renew your service and charge you for any renewal term.

<h3>10.3 Updates to Your Billing Account.</h3> You must keep all information in your billing account current, including your billing address and the expiration date of your credit card. You can access your billing account at https://billing.Videntity.com, where you can make changes to your billing account. You may change your payment method at any time. If you tell us to stop using your payment method, we may cancel your service. Your notice to us will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we reasonably could act on your request.


<h3>10.4 Trial Period Offers.</h3> You may have received a limited time of free service or some other trial period offer. Unless we notify you otherwise, if you are participating in any trial period offer, you must cancel the service by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring charges. If you do not cancel your service, and we have informed you that the service will automatically be converted into a paid subscription at the end of the trial period, then you authorize us to charge your payment method for the service.

<h3>10.5 Prices and Price Increases.</h3> The price for the service excludes all taxes and phone charges, unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for any taxes that you are obligated to pay or that we may collect from you. You are responsible for all other charges (for example, phone charges). Currency exchange settlements are based on your agreement with your payment method provider. We may change the price of the service from time to time, but we will tell you before we do.

    * If there is a specific time length and price for your service offer, then that price will remain in force for that time. After the offer period ends, your use of the service will be charged at the new price.
    * If your service is on a period basis (for example, monthly), with no specific time length, then we will tell you the date of any price change. That date will be not less than 30 days after we tell you of the price change. 

If you do not agree to these changes, then you must cancel and stop using the service before the changes take place. If you cancel your service, then your service ends at the end of your current service time length or, if we bill your account on a period basis, at the end of the period in which you cancelled.

<h3>10.6 Refund Policies.</h3> Unless otherwise provided by law or in connection with any particular service offer, all charges are non-refundable, and the costs of any returns will be at your expense.

<h3>10.7 Online Statement Errors.</h3> We will provide you with an online billing statement. This is the only billing statement that we provide. Go to https://videntity.com/billing to view, print or request a paper copy of this statement. If you request a paper copy, we may charge you a retrieval fee. We will only provide paper copies for the past 120 days. If we make an error on your bill, we will correct it promptly after you tell us and we investigate the charge. You must tell us within 120 days after an error first appears on your bill. You release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from any error that you do not report to us within 120 days after the error first appears on your online statement. If you do not tell us within this time, we will not be required to correct the error. We can correct billing errors at any time.

<h3>10.8 Canceling the Service.</h3> You may cancel the service at any time, with or without cause. Go to https://videntity.com/billing v obtain information on cancelling your service. Certain service offers may require cancellation charges, and you will pay all cancellation charges as specified in the materials describing the offer. Cancellation of the service by you will not alter your obligation to pay all charges made to your billing account.

<h3>10.9 Late Payments.</h3> Except to the extent prohibited by law, we may assess a late charge if you do not pay on time. You must pay these late charges when we bill you for them. The late charge will be the lesser of 1% of the unpaid amount each month or the maximum rate that is permitted by law. We may use a third party to collect past due amounts. You must pay for all reasonable costs we incur to collect any past due amounts. These costs may include reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal fees and costs. We may suspend or cancel your service if you fail to pay in full on time.


<h3>10.10 Internet Access Service.</h3> If the service does not include Internet access, then you are responsible for paying the fees charged by your Internet access provider. Those fees are in addition to the fees you pay us for the service. The rest of this section applies only if your service includes Internet access.

If you use a dial-up modem, you are responsible for determining if the numbers you select will incur toll charges. To do this you must contact your telephone company first. Tell it the numbers you consider using. Your telephone company can tell you if using those numbers will trigger additional charges. Ask it if there are other telephone service charges you will incur using those numbers. You should contact your phone company even if we provided the number as an appropriate access number for you. We rely on others to provide us with that information. Unfortunately, sometimes it is wrong. If you incur any extra charges, then you must pay them. We will not reimburse you for them.

You also will pay any additional charges you incur if you connect to the service through a service telephone number while you are in a country that is not the country associated with your service account ("roaming charges"). Roaming charges are in addition to any long distance telephone charges you may incur when connecting to the service from another country. Please check the service information area to view the current rates for roaming charges. You may also incur additional charges if your usage of the service exceeds the number of hours covered by your service plan.
